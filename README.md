# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub

I am a PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh studying Bioengineering.

I have recently become very interested in learning Python to expand my programming knowledge from just Matlab.

I am new to Git and GitHub, and am trying to learn how to use them to improve my coding projects as I learn Python.
